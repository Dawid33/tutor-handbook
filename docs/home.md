# What is this?

An example of a tutor handbook that can help facilite learning of computer
science topics. This kind of handbook should direct a tutor in the right
direction, suggesting questions to enagage a student along with appropriate
learning material for further study.

## Structure

- An article should start with a few paragraphs explaining the key information
that needs to be understood about the topic. Each paragraph should have
questions to help ensure the student understood the key points that a given
paragraph is trying to convey. 

- The remaining article is an elaboration on the topic with short paragraphs and
a strong emphasis on potential questions to ask the student.  Videos and
questions based on those videos are also great. 

- The final part is a list of things a student can look at next or might find
useful in relation to that topic. This section should not link back to other
articles in the book. It should be focused on common pitfalls, additional /
alternative learning resources for that topic and other things a student might
be interested in.  Resources about tangential issues that the student might be
facing are another good choice.

How a tutor uses the handbook is entirely up to the tutor and student. For
example, it may or may not be appropriate to watch the videos with the student
and question him afterwards, addtional questions may need to be asked, better
explanations offered etc. It should, however, be a good baseline to work off of.
