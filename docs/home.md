# What is this?

An example of a tutor handbook that can help facilite learning of computer
science topics. This kind of should direct a tutor in the right direction,
suggesting questions to enagage a student and appropriate learning material for
further study.

## Structure

An article should start with a few paragraphs explaining the key information
that should be understood about the topic. Each paragraph should have questions
to help ensure the student understood the key points that the paragraph is
trying to convey. The remaining article is either an elaboration on the topic
with short paragraphs and a strong emphasis on potential questions to ask the
student. Videos and questions based on those videos are also great. The final
part is a list of things to look at next.

The further reading section should not link back to other articles in the book.
It should be focused on common pitfalls, additional / alternative learning
resources for that topic and other things a student might be interested in.

How a tutor uses the handbook is entirely up to the tutor and student. For
example, it may or may not be appropriate to watch the videos with the student
and question him afterwards, addtional questions may need to be asked, better
explanations offered etc. It should, however, be a good baseline to work off of.
