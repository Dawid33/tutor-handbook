# Variables

1. (a) How can I declare a variable?  
   (b) Why does a variables data type matter?

Variables are used to represent values that may be changed in the program.
Each variable denotes data of a certain type. To use a variable, you
declare it by telling the compiler its name as well as what type of data it
can store. The variable declaration tells the compiler to allocate appropriate
amount of memory for the variable based on its data type.

2. How can I assign a value to a variable?

After a variable is declared, you can assign a value to it by using an
assignment statement. The equal sign (=) is used as the assignment
operator. To assign a value to a variable, you must place the variable name
to the left of the equals sign and an expression on the right. An expression
represents a computation involving values, variables, and operators that, taking
them together, evaluates to a value.

* In what way is it different to use a variable name on the left side of an
assignment statment compared to the right side in an expression?


Things to consider: 

* What happens when an expression is put on the left side of the assignment
statement?

* What happens when a variable is used before it is given a value?
