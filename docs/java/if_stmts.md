# Conditional Statments 

Java has several types of selection statements: one-way if statements, two-way
if-else statements, nested if statements, switch statements, and conditional
expressions.

## If Example

```
if (radius >= 0) {
  area = radius * radius * PI;
  System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +
  radius + " is " + area);
}
```
