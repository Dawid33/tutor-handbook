# Compiler

1. (a) What is an interpreter? How would you compile and / or execute a java
       program?

Programming in java consists of three actions. Firstly, the programmer creates
a program by typing it into a file named. That file is then  compiled into an
alternative representation of that code called bytecode by using a compiler.
Finally, the user can run (or execute) it by using a program called a java
interpreter.

Things to consider:

- What is the Java source filename extension, and what is the Java bytecode
file-name extension?

- What are the input and output of a Java compiler?

- What is the JVM?
